# Description
- Uses a Neural Network engine (built from scratch) to determine the quality of a drink and validity of bank notes.

# Exampes:
- Drink Quality: `data/drink_quality.csv`
- Bank Note Authentication: `banknote_authentication.csv`

# Drink Quality
- For the drink quality neural network, there are 12 nodes in the input layer and one node in the output layer
- Input layer: `fixed acidity,volatile acidity,citric acid,residual sugar,chlorides,free sulfur dioxide,total sulfur dioxide,density,pH,sulphates,alcohol`
- Output layer: `quality`

# Bank Note Authentication
- For the drink bank note authenitcation network, there are 4 nodes in the input layer and one node in the output layer
- Input layer: `variance,skewness,curtosis,entropy`
- Output layer: `target`
